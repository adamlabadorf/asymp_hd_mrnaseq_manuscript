  abstract = "Huntington's and Parkinson's Diseases (HD and PD) are
              neurodegenerative disorders that share some pathological features
              but are disparate in others. For example, while both diseases are
              marked by aberrant protein aggregation in the brain, the specific
              proteins that aggregate and types of neurons affected differ. A
              better understanding of the molecular similarities and
              differences between these two diseases may lead to a more
              complete mechanistic picture of both the individual diseases and
              the neurodegenerative process in general. We sought to
              characterize the common transcriptional signature of HD and PD as
              well as genes uniquely implicated in each of these diseases using
              mRNA-Seq data from post mortem human brains in comparison to
              neuropathologically normal controls. The enriched biological
              pathways implicated by HD differentially expressed genes show
              remarkable consistency with those for PD differentially expressed
              genes and implicate the common biological processes of
              neuroinflammation, apoptosis, transcriptional dysregulation, and
              neuron-associated functions. Comparison of the differentially
              expressed (DE) genes highlights a set of consistently altered
              genes that span both diseases. In particular, processes involving
              nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
              (NFkB) and transcription factor cAMP response element-binding
              protein (CREB) are the most prominent among the genes common to
              HD and PD. When the combined HD and PD data are compared to
              controls, relatively few additional biological processes emerge
              as significantly enriched suggesting that most pathways are
              independently seen within each disorder. Despite showing
              comparable numbers of DE genes, DE genes unique to HD are
              enriched in far more coherent biological processes than the DE
              genes unique to PD, suggesting that PD may represent a more
              heterogeneous disorder. The complexity of the biological
              processes implicated by this analysis provides impetus for the
              development of better experimental models to validate the
              results.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing provides a count of RNA
              molecules in the form of short reads, yielding discrete, often
              highly non-normally distributed gene expression measurements.
              Although Negative Binomial (NB) regression has been generally
              accepted in the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, its
              appropriateness has not been exhaustively evaluated. We explore
              logistic regression as an alternative method for RNA-Seq studies
              designed to compare cases and controls, where disease status is
              modeled as a function of RNA-Seq reads using simulated and
              Huntington disease data. We evaluate the effect of adjusting for
              covariates that have an unknown relationship with gene
              expression. Finally, we incorporate the data adaptive method in
              order to compare false positive rates. RESULTS: When the sample
              size is small or the expression levels of a gene are highly
              dispersed, the NB regression shows inflated Type-I error rates
              but the Classical logistic and Bayes logistic (BL) regressions
              are conservative. Firth's logistic (FL) regression performs well
              or is slightly conservative. Large sample size and low dispersion
              generally make Type-I error rates of all methods close to nominal
              alpha levels of 0.05 and 0.01. However, Type-I error rates are
              controlled after applying the data adaptive method. The NB, BL,
              and FL regressions gain increased power with large sample size,
              large log2 fold-change, and low dispersion. The FL regression has
              comparable power to NB regression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
              implementing the data adaptive method appropriately controls
              Type-I error rates in RNA-Seq analysis. Firth's logistic
              regression provides a concise statistical inference process and
              reduces spurious associations from inaccurately estimated
              dispersion parameters in the negative binomial framework.",

              the body deals with injury and infection to eliminate the initial
              cause of cell injury and effect repair. Unlike a normally
              beneficial acute inflammatory response, chronic inflammation can
              lead to tissue damage and ultimately its destruction, and often
              results from an inappropriate immune response. Inflammation in
              the nervous system (``neuroinflammation''), especially when
              prolonged, can be particularly injurious. While inflammationper
              semay not cause disease, it contributes importantly to disease
              pathogenesis across both the peripheral (neuropathic pain,
              fibromyalgia) and central [e.g., Alzheimer disease, Parkinson
              disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, ischemia and
              traumatic brain injury, depression, and autism spectrum disorder]
              nervous systems. The existence of extensive lines of
              communication between the nervous system and immune system
              represents a fundamental principle underlying neuroinflammation.
              Immune cell-derived inflammatory molecules are critical for
              regulation of host responses to inflammation. Although these
              mediators can originate from various non-neuronal cells,
              important sources in the above neuropathologies appear to be
              microglia and mast cells, together with astrocytes and possibly
              also oligodendrocytes. Understanding neuroinflammation also
              requires an appreciation that non-neuronal cell-cell
              interactions, between both glia and mast cells and glia
              themselves, are an integral part of the inflammation process.
              Within this context the mast cell occupies a key niche in
              orchestrating the inflammatory process, from initiation to
              prolongation. This review will describe the current state of
              knowledge concerning the biology of neuroinflammation,

              neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the loss of
              dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the presence of
              $\alpha$-synuclein-containing aggregates in the substantia nigra
              pars compacta (SNpc). Chronic neuroinflammation is one of the
              hallmarks of PD pathophysiology. Post-mortem analyses of human PD
              patients and experimental animal studies indicate that activation
              of glial cells and increases in pro-inflammatory factor levels
              are common features of the PD brain. Chronic release of
              pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated astrocytes and microglia
              leads to the exacerbation of DA neuron degeneration in the SNpc.
              Besides, peripheral immune system is also implicated in the
              pathogenesis of PD. Infiltration and accumulation of immune cells
              from the periphery are detected in and around the affected brain
              regions of PD patients. Moreover, inflammatory processes have
              been suggested as promising interventional targets for PD and
              even other neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of
              the role of inflammation in PD will provide new insights into the
              pathological processes and help to establish effective
              therapeutic strategies. In this review, we will summarize recent
              progresses in the neuroimmune aspects of PD and highlight the
              potential therapeutic interventions targeting neuroinflammation.",

              been suggested as central in HD pathogenesis and also as a target
              of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of HD. We present
              results that offer a previously unexplored perspective regarding
              impaired proteostasis in HD. We find that, under non-stress
              conditions, the proteostatic capacity of cells expressing full
              length polyQ-expanded Htt is adequate. Yet, under stress
              conditions, the presence of polyQ-expanded Htt impairs the heat
              shock response, a key component of cellular proteostasis. This
              impaired heat shock response results in a reduced capacity to
              withstand the damage caused by cellular stress. We demonstrate
              that in cells expressing polyQ-expanded Htt the levels of heat
              shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) are reduced, and, as a
              consequence, these cells have an impaired a heat shock response.
              Also, we found reduced HSF1 and HSP70 levels in the striata of HD

              suggests that full length, non-aggregated polyQ-expanded Htt

              Studies have indicated that activation of the heat shock response
              can reduce many of the effects of mutant Htt in disease models,
              suggesting that the heat shock response is impaired in the
              disease. To understand the basis for this impairment, we have
              used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
              massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to examine the effects
              of mutant Htt on the master regulator of the heat shock response,
              HSF1. We find that, under normal conditions, HSF1 function is
              highly similar in cells carrying either wild-type or mutant Htt.
              However, polyQ-expanded Htt severely blunts the HSF1-mediated
              stress response. Surprisingly, we find that the HSF1 targets most

              proteostasis, but with cytoskeletal binding, focal adhesion and
              GTPase activity. Our data raise the intriguing hypothesis that
              the accumulated damage from life-long impairment in these stress

              neurodegenerative disorders. While neuronal loss, reactive
              gliosis and defects in the self-repair capacity have extensively
              been characterized in neurodegenerative disorders, the transient
              excess production of neuroblasts detected in the adult striatum
              of animal models of Huntington's disease (HD) and in post-mortem

              abnormal cellular response in the striatum appears to originate
              from the selective proliferation and ectopic migration of
              neuroblasts derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Based on
              and in line with the term ``reactive astrogliosis'', we propose
              to name the observed cellular event ``reactive neuroblastosis''.
              Although, the functional relevance of reactive neuroblastosis is
