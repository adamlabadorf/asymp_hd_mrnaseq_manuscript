  abstract = "Huntington's and Parkinson's Diseases (HD and PD) are
              neurodegenerative disorders that share some pathological features
              but are disparate in others. For example, while both diseases are
              marked by aberrant protein aggregation in the brain, the specific
              proteins that aggregate and types of neurons affected differ. A
              better understanding of the molecular similarities and
              differences between these two diseases may lead to a more
              complete mechanistic picture of both the individual diseases and
              the neurodegenerative process in general. We sought to
              characterize the common transcriptional signature of HD and PD as
              well as genes uniquely implicated in each of these diseases using
              mRNA-Seq data from post mortem human brains in comparison to
              neuropathologically normal controls. The enriched biological
              pathways implicated by HD differentially expressed genes show
              remarkable consistency with those for PD differentially expressed
              genes and implicate the common biological processes of
              neuroinflammation, apoptosis, transcriptional dysregulation, and
              neuron-associated functions. Comparison of the differentially
              expressed (DE) genes highlights a set of consistently altered
              genes that span both diseases. In particular, processes involving
              nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
              (NFkB) and transcription factor cAMP response element-binding
              protein (CREB) are the most prominent among the genes common to
              HD and PD. When the combined HD and PD data are compared to
              controls, relatively few additional biological processes emerge
              as significantly enriched suggesting that most pathways are
              independently seen within each disorder. Despite showing
              comparable numbers of DE genes, DE genes unique to HD are
              enriched in far more coherent biological processes than the DE
              genes unique to PD, suggesting that PD may represent a more
              heterogeneous disorder. The complexity of the biological
              processes implicated by this analysis provides impetus for the
              development of better experimental models to validate the
              results.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing provides a count of RNA
              molecules in the form of short reads, yielding discrete, often
              highly non-normally distributed gene expression measurements.
              Although Negative Binomial (NB) regression has been generally
              accepted in the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, its
              appropriateness has not been exhaustively evaluated. We explore
              logistic regression as an alternative method for RNA-Seq studies
              designed to compare cases and controls, where disease status is
              modeled as a function of RNA-Seq reads using simulated and
              Huntington disease data. We evaluate the effect of adjusting for
              covariates that have an unknown relationship with gene
              expression. Finally, we incorporate the data adaptive method in
              order to compare false positive rates. RESULTS: When the sample
              size is small or the expression levels of a gene are highly
              dispersed, the NB regression shows inflated Type-I error rates
              but the Classical logistic and Bayes logistic (BL) regressions
              are conservative. Firth's logistic (FL) regression performs well
              or is slightly conservative. Large sample size and low dispersion
              generally make Type-I error rates of all methods close to nominal
              alpha levels of 0.05 and 0.01. However, Type-I error rates are
              controlled after applying the data adaptive method. The NB, BL,
              and FL regressions gain increased power with large sample size,
              large log2 fold-change, and low dispersion. The FL regression has
              comparable power to NB regression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
              implementing the data adaptive method appropriately controls
              Type-I error rates in RNA-Seq analysis. Firth's logistic
              regression provides a concise statistical inference process and
              reduces spurious associations from inaccurately estimated
              dispersion parameters in the negative binomial framework.",

               preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool
               or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of
               flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high
               performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible
               and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle
               paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is
               demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks.
               Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least
               competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced
               by other tools, in all scenarios tested. AVAILABILITY AND

              disorder that is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat

              the human HD brain has been documented but is incompletely
              understood. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of mRNA
              expression in human prefrontal cortex from 20 HD and 49
              neuropathologically normal controls using next generation
              high-throughput sequencing. Surprisingly, 19\% (5,480) of the
              28,087 confidently detected genes are differentially expressed
              (FDR<0.05) and are predominantly up-regulated. A novel
              hypothesis-free geneset enrichment method that dissects large
              gene lists into functionally and transcriptionally related groups
              discovers that the differentially expressed genes are enriched
              for immune response, neuroinflammation, and developmental genes.
              Markers for all major brain cell types are observed, suggesting
              that HD invokes a systemic response in the brain area studied.
              Unexpectedly, the most strongly differentially expressed genes
              are a homeotic gene set (represented by Hox and other homeobox
              genes), that are almost exclusively expressed in HD, a profile
              not widely implicated in HD pathogenesis. The significance of
              transcriptional changes of developmental processes in the HD
              brain is poorly understood and warrants further investigation.
              The role of inflammation and the significance of non-neuronal
              involvement in HD pathogenesis suggest anti-inflammatory
              therapeutics may offer important opportunities in treating HD.",

  abstract = "Despite their abundance, the molecular functions of long
              non-coding RNAs in mammalian nervous systems remain poorly
              understood. Here we show that the long non-coding RNA, NEAT1,
              directly modulates neuronal excitability and is associated with
              pathological seizure states. Specifically, NEAT1 is dynamically
              regulated by neuronal activity in vitro and in vivo, binds
              epilepsy-associated potassium channel-interacting proteins
              including KCNAB2 and KCNIP1, and induces a neuronal
              hyper-potentiation phenotype in iPSC-derived human cortical
              neurons following antisense oligonucleotide knockdown. Next
              generation sequencing reveals a strong association of NEAT1 with
              increased ion channel gene expression upon activation of
              iPSC-derived neurons following NEAT1 knockdown. Furthermore, we
              show that while NEAT1 is acutely down-regulated in response to
              neuronal activity, repeated stimulation results in NEAT1 becoming
              chronically unresponsive in independent in vivo rat model systems
              relevant to temporal lobe epilepsy. We extended previous studies

              from high spiking regions of patients suffering from intractable
              seizures. Our results indicate a role for NEAT1 in modulating
